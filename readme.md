# Overview

{I have made this project to further my programming skills by learning c++. It has helped to further my learning of some basic concepts of programming such as loops, functions, and classes.}

{The purpose of this software is to take a list from a file and read and write to it. I choose to build a simple library application that is able to read from a file and append to the end of that file new books.}

{Here is a link to my Video Demonstration of the software.}

# Development Environment

{
Visual Studio Code
msys2 code compiler
Git / Git HUB
}

{
For this project the c++ coding language is used. 

"C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes"." - [c++ Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

# Future Work

{For future editions:}
* I would like to add a search function
* I would like to add a check out of Library function
